# Vault Libray for Unity3D (Native Plugin)

**DOWNLOAD:** [Latest build (Unity package)](https://github.com/dasannikov/Vault/releases)

Proof of concept and tests. Collection of C11 files and prebuild dynamic libraries for Unity3D with common data structures. It use optimized C11 containers that even faster than STL C++ containers (apporix. 10% faster).
- [x] `Vault.Array` - Continuous array similar to C++ `std::vector` and C# `List<T>`
- [ ] TODO. Doubly linked list
- [ ] TODO. Hash map

### Supported platforms:
- Standalone Mono. Winows/MacOS/Linux
- Standalone IL2CPP. Winows/MacOS/Linux
- Mobile. iOS/Android
- Other through IL2CPP or specific shared libraries

### Advantages:
- Fast (Native code)
- No C# allocations and GC
- You manage your memory (`Free` means delete container and release memory)
- Don't use any Unity3D features. **Universal C# code**. Can works with any .net code

## Vault.Array
`Vault.Array` is continius array of unmanaged types with dynamic array size and ability to remove element. Similar to C++ `std::vector` container. Main porpose of `Vault.Array` is dynamic and fast creation of arrays with abillity to free memory without GC.

```csharp

// New array with default initializer
var vecArr = new Vault.Array<Vector2>(10, new Vector2(1.0f, 1.0f));

// Set element value
vecArr[9] = new Vector2(101f, 102f);
vecArr[0] = new Vector2(101f, 102f);

// Resize array
vecArr.Resize(14);

// Add element to array.
vecArr.Add(new Vector2(21f, 22f));

// Fast remove element by swap with last element
vecArr.RemoveBySwap(1);

// Slow remove element by memmove. Relatively slow :)
vecArr.Remove(1);

// Swap elements
vecArr.Swap(0, 1);

// Clear array
vecArr.Clear();

// Free array after use
vecArr.Free();

```

### Performance
 Perfimance is similar (Â±10%) to generic C# `List<T>` and Unit3D `NativeList<T>`
